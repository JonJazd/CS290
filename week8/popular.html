                        The most popular heroes in the current set of cards are:</br>
                        Axe.</br>
                        Drow Ranger.</br>
                        Phantom Assassin.</br>
                        Luna.</br>
                        Axe is a red hero who has a awesome stat line with a great signature card that allows him to battle 3 enemies at once.</br>
                        Drow Ranger has a mediocre stat line, but her passive gives every ally 1 extra attack and her signature card silences all
                        enemy heroes preventing anything from being played.</br>
                        Phantom Assassin has a good stat line, but gains 4 attack when attacking heroes and can cast her signature card to instantly
                        kill an enemy hero.</br>
                        Luna has a bad stat line, but makes up for it with a passive that deals 1 damage randomly to any enemy. Every time this passive
                        triggers she gets a charge onto her signature card. When the card is played it deals 3 damage randomly
                        to an enemy once per each charge.</br>
