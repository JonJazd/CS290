Artifact is an upcoming digital collectible card game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game focuses on online player versus player battles across three boards, called lanes, and is based upon the universe of Dota 2, a multiplayer online battle arena game also developed by Valve. Artifact allows for the purchasing, selling, and trading of cards on the Steam Marketplace, and was designed by Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield. Artifact will be released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2018, and for Android and iOS devices the following year.
